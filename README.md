## General Info
An original statistical report where I analyse 532 records of sharks caught by the Queensland Shark Control Program in 2016. The Shark Control Program  uses nets, drumlines or a combination to minimise the threat of shark attacks on humans in 85 beaches along the Queensland coastline.

The data is sourced from the open data portal of the Queensland Government published by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.

I analyse 2 key questions, applying data analytic techniques to support my response.
1. At what temperatures are sharks present around Queensland beaches?
2. Are sharks caught in the summer longer than sharks caught in the winter?

This project was completed individually from scratch as part of uni coursework. Final mark was 31/35.

## Technologies and Access
The report and data analytic techniques were completed with R and R Markdown.
